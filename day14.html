    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(team, players)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team, players); // Updates the original array that team referenced

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Marc';
    console.log(team2, players);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Holy Smokes';
    console.log(players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Array.from is cool';
    console.log(players, team5);



    //Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Marc White',
        age: 100
    };

    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(person);

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 98, age: 101});


    //Object spread soon to come?
    //const cap3 = {...person};



    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
